mean:
  description: |
    Computes the mean of the values of a Tensor over the whole dataset.

    Note:
        If the tuple's elements are unsorted, this function will call preprocess_axis firstly to let these elements
        sorted. if tuple is empty, this function will compute all elements' sum.
        if the data type is folat 16 and the whole dim not less than 65536, this function will compute the mean by
        divide 65535 first to avoid whole dim too large.

    Args:
        input (tvm.tensor.Tensor): Tensor of type float16, float32.
        dim (Union[list, tuple, int, None]): If the tuple is empty, the dim equal to None.
        keepdim (bool): If keepdim equal to True, the result shape length is same to input shape length.

    Returns:
            tvm.tensor.Tensor, has the same type as input. If keepdim equal to True, all reduced dimensions are
            retained with length 1. else these reduced dim will be eliminate.
