upsample_nearest1d:
    description: |
        Apply 1D nearest neighbor interpolation upsampling to input signals consisting
        of multiple input channels. If the input shape is (N, C, L), the output shape
        is (N, C, output_size)

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The shape of tensor is
                :math:`(N,*)` where :math:`*` means, any number of additional dimensions.
            output_size(list[int]): specify the size of the output tensor, the dtype supports int64.
        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same shape and dtype as `input`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: If dtype of `input` is not float16, float32 or float64, complex64, complex128.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
