sum:
  description: |  
    Compute the sum of elements across dimensions of a tensor.
    
    Args:
      input (tvm.tensor.Tensor): Tensor.
      dims (Union[list, tuple, int, None]): If the list or tuple is empty, the dims equal to None.
      keepdim (bool): If keepdim equal to True, the result shape length is same to input shape length.
    
    Returns:
      tvm.tensor.Tensor, has same type as input. If keepdim is True, all reduced dimensions are retained
      with length 1, else these reduced dims will be eliminate.
